        <p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px">This is Dylan's first year coaching with us. Last summer was his 
        last year of elgibility of playing Babe Ruth.<br>He is currently a Junior at New Hartford high school. Dylan 
        was one of our top starting pitchers for this team.<br>Whenever he was on the mound, everyone knew he was going 
        to have a strong performance. Unfortunately, towards the end of the season<br>Dylan dislocated his shoulder from 
        sliding and was out the remainder of the season. Dylan is also a very talented hockey player along with his brother 
        Derek. With Dylan joining the staff, he'll be able to work with pitchers, third basemans, and hitters.
