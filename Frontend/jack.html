        <p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px">This is Jack's first year coaching with us. Last summer was his last 
        year of elgibility of playing Babe Ruth. 
        <br>He is currently a Sophomore at New Hartford high school. Jack has lots
        of talent as a ball player who is always<br>striving to be the best ball player he can be. Not only does he want to
        succeed, he wants his teammates to succeed<br>just as bad as he wants too. Jack will be a huge addition to our coahing
        staff because of his ability to help<br>the kids become better ball players, and because he loves to have fun.
