        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">We expect our players to come to every practice and game. 
                Must be notified otherwise. We are a competitive team.<br>
                Our players need to earn their spot on the field. Everyone must hustle, show respect to 
                coaches and teammates,<br>good attitude, and to work hard. If players do not show up to 
                practice without a valid excuse, they will not play the next game.
                <br><br>THERE IS NO BULLYING! THIS COULD RESULT IN BEING REMOVED OFF THE ROSTER!<br><br>
                These are very simple expectations, following these will help us win ball games
                and will have a fun season!</p>
